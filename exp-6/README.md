In this experiment we learnt about Handle Forms and Validations using Material UI:


the code explains :-
    > useState

          Stores form field values and error messages.

    > validate()

          Checks email format and password length. Returns true if no errors.

    > TextField

         Material UI input component with built-in error styling.

    > helperText

          Displays validation messages.

we also  learnt 
   Controlled Components & MUI: This experiment utilizes React state to manage form input values, making them "controlled components" where the state is the single source of truth. It integrates Material UI components like TextField and Button to quickly create professional, responsive forms with built-in styling.

    Validation & Error Feedback: Client-side validation logic is implemented to ensure data correctness—such as checking for valid email formats and minimum password lengths—before submission. Visual feedback is provided using MUI's error and helperText props, which display immediate error messages to the user.
