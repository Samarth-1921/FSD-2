In this experiment we lerant  about Lazy loading


       > Lazy Loading & React.lazy(): A technique to load components only when they are required, reducing the initial bundle size and improving the load speed of the application. It uses dynamic imports to ensure the component loads only when it is rendered.

       > Suspense & Fallback UI: The Suspense component wraps lazy-loaded elements and uses a fallback prop to display a temporary UI, such as a "Loading..." message, ensuring a smooth user experience while the required code chunk is being fetched.
