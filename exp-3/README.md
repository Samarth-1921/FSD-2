 In this experiment we learned about Routing in SPA
     
     > Routing in SPA means changing the view/content without reloading the page.
     > The browser URL changes, but the same HTML page stays loaded.
     >  Different components are shown based on the URL

Routing works in SPA as :-
  1. User clicks a link (e.g. /login)
  2. Router checks the URL
  3. Corresponding component is loaded
  4. Page does not refresh

Example (React idea)

/ → Home component

/About → About the website

/Contact → Contact component
